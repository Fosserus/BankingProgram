# BankingProgram
OOP practice project; A simple banking program

This is just a simple banking program that I made as part of my C++ learning journey. 
Note: this will NOT work on non-Windows systems due to the use of "system("CLS")" and "system("PAUSE")" usage. 
I don't use Linux at the moment, so it's not really in the cards to add cross-compatibility. Sorry guys. 
Feel free to edit to your heart's content!
